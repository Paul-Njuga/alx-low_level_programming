# C - More pointers, arrays & strings :computer:

This directory covers more pointers, arrays, & strings in C.

## Requirements :bookmark_tabs:

* A ```README.md``` file, at the root of the folder of the project.
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using ```betty-style.pl``` and ```betty-doc.pl```.
* All files should end with a new line.
* You are not allowed to use global variables.
* You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etcâ€¦ is forbidden.
* You are allowed to use [_putchar](https://github.com/holbertonschool/_putchar.c/blob/master/_putchar.c).
* No more than 5 functions per file.
* The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function ```_putchar``` should be included in your header file called ```main.h```.
