# C - Pointers, arrays & strings :computer:
This directory is an intro to pointers, arrays, & strings in C and covers topics such as data structures & the C memory layout.

## Requirements :bookmark_tabs:
* Allowed editors: ```vi```, ```vim```, ```emacs```
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using ```gcc``` using options ```-wall -werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89```
* All files should end with a new line
* A '''README.md''' file, at the root of the folder of the project
* You are not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etcâ€¦ is forbidden
* You are allowed to use [_putchar](https://github.com/holbertonschool/_putchar.c/blob/master/_putchar.c)
* The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using ```betty-style.pl``` and ```betty-doc.pl```

## Table of contents:
Directories | Description
----------- | -----------
[main.h](./main.h) | C header file that contains function prototypes
[0-reset_to_98.c](./0-reset_to_98.c0-reset_to_98.c) | C function that takes a pointer to an ```int``` as parameter and updates the value it points to to ```98```
[1-swap.c](./1-swap.c) | C function that swaps the values of two integers
[2-strlen.c](./2-strlen.c) | C function that returns the length of a string
[3-puts.c](./3-puts.c) | C function that prints a string to ```stdout```
[4-print_rev.c](./4-print_rev.c) | C function that prints a string in reverse
[5-rev_string.c](./5-rev_string.c) | C function that reverses a string
[6-puts2.c](./6-puts2.c) | C function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character
[7-puts_half.c](./7-puts_half.c) | C function that prints half of a string
[8-print_array.c](./8-print_array.c) | C function that prints ```n``` elements of an array of integers
[9-strcpy.c](./9-strcpy.c) | C function that copies the string pointed to by ```src```, including the terminating null byte (```\0```), to the buffer pointed to by ```dest```
