# C - Hello, World :computer:
This project is an intro to C and covers topics such as C, it's compilation process, & the Betty Coding style.

## Requirements :bookmark_tabs:
### C
* Allowed editors: ```vi```, ```vim```, ```emacs```
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using ```gcc``` using options ```-wall -werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89```
* All files should end with a new line
* There should be no errors and no warnings during compilation
* You are not allowed to use ```system```
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl

### Shell Scripts
* All your scripts should be exactly two lines long (```$ wc -l file``` should print 2)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly ```#!/bin/bash```
