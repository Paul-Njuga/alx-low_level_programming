# C - Hello, World :computer

This project is an intro to C and covers topics such as C, it's compilation process, & the Betty Coding style.

## man or help

* ```gcc```
* ```printf (3)```
* ```puts```
* ```putchar```

## Requirements :bookmark_tabs

### C

* All files should end with a new line.
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using ```betty-style.pl``` and ```betty-doc.pl```.
* There should be no errors and no warnings during compilation.

### Shell Scripts

* All your scripts should be exactly two lines long (```$ wc -l file``` should print 2).
* The first line of all your files should be exactly ```#!/bin/bash```.
* All your files should end with a new line.
