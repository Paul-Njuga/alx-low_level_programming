# C - Functions, nested loops :computer:
This directory is an intro to functions and nested loops in C and covers topics such as function prototypes & header files.

## Requirements :bookmark_tabs:
* Allowed editors: ```vi```, ```vim```, ```emacs```
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using ```gcc``` using options ```-wall -werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89```
* All files should end with a new line
* A ```README.md``` file, at the root of the folder of the project
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using ```betty-style.pl``` and ```betty-doc.pl```
* You are not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like ```printf```, ```puts```, etcâ€¦ is forbidden
* You are allowed to use [_putchar](https://github.com/holbertonschool/_putchar.c/blob/master/_putchar.c)
* The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function ```\_putchar``` should be included in your header file called main.h
