# C - More functions, more nested loops :computer

This directory covers more functions and nested loops in C.

## Requirements :bookmark_tabs

* A ```README.md``` file, at the root of the folder of the project.
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using ```betty-style.pl``` and ```betty-doc.pl```.
* All files should end with a new line.
* You are not allowed to use global variables.
* You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etcâ€¦ is forbidden.
* You are allowed to use [_putchar](https://github.com/holbertonschool/_putchar.c/blob/master/_putchar.c).
* No more than 5 functions per file.
* The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called ```main.h```.

## Table of contents

Directories | Description
----------- | -----------
[main.h](./main.h) | C header file that contains function prototypes
[0-isupper.c](./0-isupper.c) | C function that checks for uppercase character
[1-isdigit.c](./1-isdigit.c) | C function that checks for a digit (```0``` through ```9```)
[2-mul.c](./2-mul.c) | C function that multiplies two integers
[3-print_numbers.c](./3-print_numbers.c) | C function that prints the numbers ```0``` through ```9```
[4-print_most_numbers.c](./4-print_most_numbers.c) | C function that prints the numbers ```0``` through ```9```
[5-more_numbers.c](./5-more_numbers.c) | C function that prints 10 times the numbers ```0``` through ```14```
[6-print_line.c](./6-print_line.c) | C function that draws a straight line in the terminal
[7-print_diagonal.c](./7-print_diagonal.c) | C function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal
[8-print_square.c](./8-print_square.c) | C function that prints a square
[9-fizz_buzz.c](./9-fizz_buzz.c) | C program that prints the numbers from ```0``` through ```100```. But for multiples of three, print ```Fizz``` instead of the number. For multiples of five, print ```Buzz```. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print ```FizzBuzz```
[10-print_triangle.c](./10-print_triangle.c) | C function that prints a triangle
[100-prime_factor.c](./100-prime_factor.c) | C program that finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number ```612852475143```
[101-print_number.c](./101-print_number.c) | C function that prints an integer
